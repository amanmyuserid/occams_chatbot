If you‚Äôre a startup, you may have the option to use this credit against the employer‚Äôs portion of social security taxes up to $250,000 per year.

    "title": "28. What \"orders from an appropriate governmental authority\" may be taken into account for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit? (updated June 19, 2020)",
    "content": "Orders, proclamations, or decrees from the Federal government, or any State or local government are considered \"orders from an appropriate governmental authority\" if they limit commerce, travel, or group meetings due to COVID-19 in a manner that affects an employer's operation of its trade or business, including orders that limit hours of operation and, if they are from a State or local government, they are from a State or local government that has jurisdiction over the employer's operations (referred to as a \"governmental order\").\n\nStatements from a governmental official, including comments made during press conferences or in interviews with the media, do not rise to the level of a governmental order for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Additionally, the declaration of a state of emergency by a governmental authority is not sufficient to rise to the level of a governmental order if it does not limit commerce, travel, or group meetings in any manner. Further, such a declaration that limits commerce, travel, or group meetings, but does so in a manner that does not affect the employer's operation of its trade or business does not rise to the level of a governmental order.\n\nA governmental order allows employers to qualify as Eligible Employers for purposes of claiming the Employee Retention Credit without regard to the level of enforcement of the governmental order.\n\nGovernmental orders include:\n- An order from the city's mayor stating that all non-essential businesses must close for a specified period;\n- A State's emergency proclamation that residents must shelter in place for a specified period, other than residents who are employed by an essential business and who may travel to and work at the workplace location;\n- An order from a local official imposing a curfew on residents that impacts the operating hours of a trade or business for a specified period;\n- An order from a local health department mandating a workplace closure for cleaning and disinfecting.\n\nWhether the operations of a trade or business are considered essential or non-essential will often vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. An employer should determine whether it is an essential or non-essential business by referring to the governmental order affecting the employer's operation of its trade or business. For more information on when a business's operations are considered to be fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order, see \"Determining When an Employer's Trade or Business Operations are Considered to be Fully or Partially Suspended Due to a Governmental Order.\"\n\nExample 1:Governor of State Y issues an order that all non-essential businesses must close from March 20, 2020 until April 30, 2020. The order provides a list of non-essential businesses, including gyms, spas, nightclubs, barber shops, hair salons, tattoo parlors, physical therapy offices, waxing salons, fitness centers, bowling alleys, arcades, racetracks, indoor children's play areas, theaters, chiropractors, planetariums, museums, and performing arts centers. Employers that provide essential services may remain open. The governor's order is a governmental order limiting the operations of non-essential businesses, entitling employers with non-essential businesses to claim the Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages.\n\nExample 2: Mayor of City Y holds a press conference in which she encourages residents to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The statement during the press conference is not an order limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings. Accordingly, the mayor's statement would not be a governmental order for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\n\nExample 3: A restaurant is ordered by a local health department to close due to a health code violation. Since the order is unrelated to COVID-19, it would not be considered a governmental order for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit."

Qualified wages include the Eligible Employer‚Äôs qualified health plan expenses that are properly allocable to the wages. The definition of qualified wages depends, in part, on the average number of full-time employees (as defined in section 4980H of the Code) employed by the Eligible Employer during 2019. If the Eligible Employer averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, qualified wages are the wages paid to an employee for time that the employee is not providing services due to an economic hardship, specifically, either (1) a full or partial suspension of operations by order of a governmental authority due to COVID-19, or (2) a significant decline in gross receipts. For these employers, qualified wages taken into account for an employee may not exceed what the employee would have been paid for working an equivalent duration during the 30 days immediately preceding the period of economic hardship described in (1) or (2) above. If the Eligible Employer averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019, qualified wages are the wages paid to any employee during any period of economic hardship described in (1) or (2) above.

    "title": "12. What makes the Employee Retention Credit \"fully refundable\"?",
    "content": "The credit is fully refundable because the Eligible Employer may get a refund if the amount of the credit is more than certain federal employment taxes the Eligible Employer owes. That is, if for any calendar quarter the amount of the credit the Eligible Employer is entitled to exceeds the employer‚Äôs share of the social security tax on all wages (or on all compensation for employers subject to RRTA) paid to all employees, then the excess is treated as an overpayment and refunded to the employer under sections 6402(a) and 6413(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù). Consistent with its treatment as an overpayment, the excess will be applied to offset any remaining tax liability on the employment tax return and the amount of any remaining excess will be reflected as an overpayment on the return. Like other overpayments of federal taxes, the overpayment will be subject to offset under section 6402(a) of the Code prior to being refunded to the employer.

Employers also report any qualified sick\n                            leave and qualified family leave wages for which they are entitled to a credit under FFCRA\n                            on Form 941. The Form 941 is used to report income and social security and Medicare taxes\n                            withheld by the employer from employee wages, as well as the employer‚Äôs share of social\n                            security and Medicare tax.\n\nIn anticipation of receiving the Employee Retention Credit, Eligible Employers can fund\n                            qualified wages by: (1) accessing federal employment taxes, including withheld taxes that\n                            are required to be deposited with the IRS, and (2) requesting an advance of the credit from\n                            the IRS for the amount of the credit that is not funded by accessing the federal employment\n                            tax deposits, by filing Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to\n                                COVID-19.\n\nFor more information, see Deferral of employment tax deposits and payments\n                                through December 31, 2020.\n\nThe IRS recently posted Frequently Asked Questions addressing the employer‚Äôs ability to\n                            defer the deposit of all of the employer‚Äôs share of social security taxes due before January\n                            1, 2021 under section 2302 of the CARES Act and reduce other employment taxes required to be\n                            deposited in an amount equal to the FFCRA sick leave and family leave credits and the\n                            Employee Retention Credit.\n\nExample: Employer E paid $10,000 in qualified wages (including qualified health plan\n                            expenses) and, after deferral of the employer‚Äôs share of social security tax, is otherwise\n                            required to deposit $8,000 in federal employment taxes for all of its employees for wage\n                            payments made during the same quarter as the $10,000 in qualified wages. Employer E has no\n                            paid sick or family leave credits under the FFCRA. Employer E may keep up to $5,000 of the\n                            $8,000 of taxes Employer E was going to deposit, and it will not owe a penalty for keeping\n                            the $5,000. Employer E will later account for the $5,000 it retained when it files Form 941,\n                            Employer‚Äôs Quarterly Federal Tax Return, for the quarter."

In its first payroll period of the second quarter of 2020, Employer F pays\n                            $10,000 in qualified wages and $3,500 in qualified sick and family leave wages under the\n                            FFCRA, among other wages for the payroll period. Employer F has a federal employment tax\n                            deposit obligation of $9,000 for the first payroll period of the second quarter of 2020 (of\n                            which $1,500 relates to the employer‚Äôs share of social security tax) prior to (a) any\n                            deferral of the deposit of the employer‚Äôs share of social security tax under section 2302 of\n                            the CARES Act and (b) any amount of federal employment taxes not deposited in anticipation\n                            of credits for qualified sick and family leave wages under the FFCRA. Employer F reasonably\n                            anticipates a $5,000 Employee Retention Credit (50 percent of qualified wages) and a $3,500\n                            credit for paid sick and family leave (100 percent of qualified sick and family leave wages)\n                            thus far for the second quarter.\n\nEmployer F first defers deposit of the $1,500 employer‚Äôs share of social security tax under\n                            section 2302 of the CARES Act. This preliminarily results in a remaining federal employment\n                            tax deposit obligation of $7,500. Employer F then reduces this federal employment tax\n                            deposit obligation by the $3,500 anticipated credit for qualified sick and family leave\n                            wages, leaving a federal employment tax deposit obligation of $4,000. Finally, Employer F\n                            further reduces the deposit of all remaining federal employment taxes by $4,000 for the\n                            $5,000 anticipated Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages. Employer F will not incur\n                            a failure to deposit penalty under section 6656 of the Code for reducing its federal\n                            employment tax deposit for the first payroll period of the second quarter to $0.\n\nThe amount of the excess $1,000 in Employee Retention Credit available is refundable as an\n                            overpayment. Employer F may file a Form 7200 to request a credit or refund of this amount in\n                            advance of the close of the quarter (but not for any amount of the Employee Retention Credit\n                            that was already used to reduce the deposit obligation). If Employer F does not request an\n                            advance, it may request that the $1,000 overpayment be credited or refunded when it files\n                            its second quarter Form 941, Employer‚Äôs Quarterly Federal Tax Return.\n\nEmployer F may defer payment of the $1,500 employer‚Äôs share of social security tax (along\n                            with any other employer social security tax imposed under section 3111(a) for the quarter)\n                            on its Form 941 for the second quarter of 2020. Employer F will not be required to pay any\n                            portion of the deferred amount until December 31, 2021, at which time 50 percent is due\n                            ($750), with the remaining amount ($750) due December 31, 2022. If Employer F fails to pay\n                            the required amounts at those times, Employer F‚Äôs deferred deposits will lose their deferred\n                            status and may be subject to failure to deposit penalties from their original due dates.\n                            Employer F may also be subject to failure to pay penalties accruing from the deferred due\n                            date for payment."

There are very specific eligibility requirements for claiming the ERC. Eligible employers can claim the ERC on an original or amended employment tax return for qualified wages paid between March 13, 2020, and December 31, 2021. However, to be eligible, employers must have either: Sustained a full or partial suspension of operations due to an order from an appropriate governmental authority limiting commerce, travel or group meetings because of COVID-19 during 2020 or the first three quarters of 2021, or Experienced a significant decline in gross receipts during 2020 or a decline in gross receipts during the first three quarters of 2021, or Qualified as a recovery startup business for the third or fourth quarters of 2021.

However, they may also include certain health care expenses you pay for your employees. Not all wages that you pay to employees may be qualified wages for purposes of the ERC. Be wary of anyone who says you can use all wages when calculating your ERC. Different dollar limits apply and the rules vary by the quarter for which you're claiming the ERC. The amount of your qualified wages used to calculate your ERC will also depend on certain factors, including: The average number of employees you employed in 2019; Whether the employees provided services for the wages you paid during the suspension of operations or the quarter in which there was the requisite decline in gross receipts; How the related individual rules apply to your situation; Whether the wages were used to claim other tax credits; and Whether the wages were used as payroll costs for other programs (Paycheck Protection Program, shuttered venue operators grant or restaurant revitalization grant).

If your customers were affected by a stay-at-home order, but no orders applied to your business operations, you weren't suspended. If you voluntarily closed your business or reduced hours of operation, you weren't ordered to suspend.

The IRS considers \"more than nominal\" to be at least 10% of your business based on either the gross receipts from that part of the business or the total hours your employees spent working in that part of the business. If all parts of your business could operate but you had to modify how it operated, then we will consider you to be partially suspended if you can show that the order had more than a nominal effect on your business. We consider \"more than a nominal effect\" to be at least a 10% reduction in your ability to provide goods or services in the normal course of your business. If you changed business practices to alter behavior, such as making store aisles one-way or requiring customers or employees to wear masks, we won't consider that change to have had a more than a nominal effect on your business operations.

    "content": "A1. A supply chain issue by itself does not qualify you for the ERC. The IRS provided a narrow, limited exception if an employer was not fully or partially suspended but their supplier was. However, it applied only when the employer absolutely could not operate without the supplier's product and the supplier was fully or partially suspended themselves. In addition to having the supplier's governmental order, you will need to show that: The government order caused the supplier to suspend operations, You couldn't obtain the supplier's goods or materials elsewhere (regardless of cost), and It caused a full or partial suspension of your own business operations. You should be wary of anyone who says you qualify for ERC based on supply chain issues without asking for specific information about how your business or organization was affected, your supplier's situation and documentation.

    "title": "Q1. How do I tell if I have the required decline in gross receipts to claim the ERC? (updated September 14, 2023)",
    "content": "A1. You may qualify for ERC if your business or organization experienced a significant decline in gross receipts during 2020 or a decline in gross receipts during the first three quarters of 2021. Generally, this test is met by comparing the gross receipts of the calendar quarter in which ERC is considered to the gross receipts of the same calendar quarter in 2019. For 2020, you begin qualifying in the quarter when your gross receipts are less than 50% of the gross receipts for the same quarter in 2019. You no longer qualify in the quarter after the quarter in which your gross receipts are more than 80% of the same quarter in 2019. For example: Your gross receipts were $100 in each quarter of 2019. They were $45 in the second quarter of 2020, $85 in the third quarter and $75 in the fourth quarter. Under these facts, you would qualify for the second and third quarter but not the fourth. For 2021, the gross receipts for the quarter must be less than 80% of the gross receipts for the same quarter in 2019. For calendar quarters in 2021, you can also use the alternative quarter election rule, which gives employers the ability to look at the prior calendar quarter and compare to the same calendar quarter in 2019 to determine whether there was a decline in gross receipts. For example: Your gross receipts were $100 in each quarter of 2019. They were $75 in the first quarter of 2021 and $85 in the second quarter. Under these facts, you would qualify for the first quarter using the regular gross receipts test and for the second quarter using the alternative quarter election rule. Be sure to keep thorough records and consider whether you need to coordinate with another part of your business, such as if you're part of an aggregated group.

    "content": "A2. Gross receipts for purposes of the ERC are defined by reference to existing law. Learn more about the specific rules in Notice 2021-20, Section III.E, Questions 24 and 25. For an employer other than a tax-exempt organization, gross receipts for ERC purposes generally means gross receipts of the taxable year. It generally includes: Total sales (net of returns and allowances), All amounts received for services, Any income from investments, Any income from incidental or outside sources. For example, gross receipts for an employer that is not a tax-exempt organization may include: Interest (including original issue discount and certain tax-exempt interest, Dividends, rents, royalties and annuities, regardless of whether those amounts are derived in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business. For an employer that is a tax-exempt organization, gross receipts means the gross amount received by the organization from all sources without reduction for any costs or expenses, including: Cost of goods or assets sold, Cost of operations, Expenses of earning, raising or collecting such amounts. For example, gross receipts for an employer that is a tax-exempt organization may include gross sales or receipts from business activities (including business activities unrelated to the purpose for which the organization qualifies for exemption) and the gross amount received: As contributions, gifts, grants and similar amounts without reduction for the expenses of raising and collecting such amounts, As dues or assessments from members or affiliated organizations without reduction for expenses attributable to the receipt of such amounts, From the sale of assets without reduction for cost or other basis and expenses of sale, As investment income, such as interest, dividends, rents and royalties."

To be eligible as a recovery startup business, you can't be eligible for ERC under the full or partial suspension test or the gross receipts test. A recovery startup business can claim ERC only for the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and may claim a maximum of $50,000 of ERC per quarter.

For example, businesses that file quarterly employment tax returns can file Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, to claim the credit for prior 2020 and 2021 quarters. Reminder: If you file Form 941-X to claim the Employee Retention Credit, you must reduce your deduction for wages by the amount of the credit for that same tax period.

The amount of your ERC reduces the amount that you are allowed to report as wage expense on your income tax return for the tax year in which the qualified wages were paid or incurred. Generally, most taxpayers claim wage expense as a deduction on their income tax returns. However, for some taxpayers, wage expense is properly capitalized to the basis of a particular asset or as an inventory cost. You should amend your income tax return to reduce the amount of your original wage expense if that adjustment has not yet been made by: reducing the prior wage deduction, or reducing the prior amount capitalized (and making any resulting adjustment, such as reducing a depreciation deduction)."

Scam promoters use several different tactics to mislead people who have no chance of meeting the requirements for the Employee Retention Credit while charging them excessive fees ‚Äì often thousands of dollars. Warning signs of aggressive ERC marketing to watch out for: Unsolicited calls or advertisements mentioning an \"easy application process,\" or offering a short eligibility checklist. Statements that the promoter or company can determine ERC eligibility within minutes. Large upfront fees to claim the credit. Fees based on a percentage of the refund amount of Employee Retention Credit claimed. This is a similar warning sign for average taxpayers, who should always avoid a tax preparer basing their fee on the size of the refund. Preparers refusing to sign the ERC return being filed by the business, exposing just the taxpayer claiming the credit to risk. Aggressive claims from the promoter that the business receiving the solicitation qualifies before any discussion of the group's tax situation. In reality, the Employee Retention Credit is a complex credit that requires careful review before applying. The IRS also sees wildly aggressive suggestions from marketers urging businesses to submit the claim because there is nothing to lose. In reality, those improperly receiving the credit could have to repay the credit ‚Äì along with substantial interest and penalties. Unscrupulous promoters may lie about eligibility requirements, including refusing to provide detailed documents supporting their computations of the ERC. In addition, those using these companies could be at risk of someone using the credit as a ploy to steal the taxpayer's identity or take a cut of the taxpayer's improperly claimed credit. The IRS continues to see a variety of ways that promoters can lure businesses, tax-exempt groups and others into applying for the credit. Aggressive marketing. This can be seen in countless places, including radio, television and online as well as phone calls and text messages. Direct mailing. Some ERC mills are sending out fake letters to taxpayers from the non-existent groups like the \"Department of Employee Retention Credit.\" These letters can be made to look like official IRS correspondence or an official government mailing with language urging immediate action. Leaving out key details. Third-party promoters of the ERC often don't accurately explain eligibility requirements or how the credit is computed. They may make broad arguments suggesting that all employers are eligible without evaluating an employer's individual circumstances. For example: Only recovery startup businesses are eligible for the ERC in the fourth quarter of 2021, but promoters fail to explain this limit. Promoters may not inform taxpayers that they need to reduce wage deductions claimed on their business' federal income tax return by the amount of the Employee Retention Credit. This causes a domino effect of tax problems for the business. Many of these promoters don't tell employers that they can't claim the ERC on wages that were reported as payroll costs to obtain Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness."

Promoters who are marketing this ultimately have a vested interest in making money; in many cases they are not looking out for the best interests of those applying.

Although Employer H is an essential business, Employer H is considered to have a partial suspension of operations due to the governmental order that prevents Employer H from performing elective and non-urgent medical procedures\nExample 5:\nEmployer I, a grocery store, is considered to be operating an essential business under a governmental order. However, the governmental order requires grocery stores to discontinue their self-serve offerings, such as salad bars, though they may offer prepared or prepackaged food. Employer I modifies its operations to close its salad bar and other self-serve offerings and instead offers prepackaged salads and other items. The governmental order requiring Employer I to discontinue its self-serve offerings does not have more than a nominal effect on Employer I‚Äôs business operations under the facts and circumstances, even though Employer I was required to modify its business operations. Employer I‚Äôs business operations are not considered to be partially suspended because the governmental order requiring closure of self-serve offerings does not have more than a nominal effect on its business operations.\nExample 6:\nEmployer J, a large retailer, is required to close its storefront location due to a governmental order, but is permitted to provide customers with curbside service to pick up items ordered online or by phone. During this period, Employer J‚Äôs business operations are considered to have been partially suspended due to the governmental order requiring it to close its storefront location. Two months later, under a subsequent governmental order, Employer J is permitted to reopen its storefront location. Under the subsequent governmental order, however, Employer J must enforce social distancing guidelines that require Employer J to admit only a specified number of customers into the store per 1,000 square feet. While the governmental order results in customers waiting in line for a short period of time to enter the store during certain busy times of the week, the size of Employer J‚Äôs storefront location is large enough that it is able to accommodate all of its customers after these short waits outside the store. The governmental order requiring Employer J to enforce social distancing guidelines does not have more than a nominal effect on Employer J‚Äôs business operations under the facts and circumstances, even though Employer J is required to modify its business operations. During this period, Employer J‚Äôs business operations are not considered to be partially suspended because the governmental order requiring enforcement of social distancing guidelines does not have more than a nominal effect on its operations."

    "title": "35. Are an employer's operations considered to be partially suspended for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit if the employer is required to reduce its operating hours by a governmental order? (updated June 19, 2020)",
    "content": "Yes. An employer that reduces its operating hours due to a governmental order is considered to have partially suspended its operations since the employer‚Äôs operations have been limited by a governmental order.\nThe employer may also be an Eligible Employer if it experiences a significant decline in gross receipts. For more information on what constitutes a significant decline in gross receipts, see Determining When an Employer is Considered to have a Significant Decline in Gross Receipts.\nExample:\nEmployer K operates a food processing facility that normally operates 24 hours a day. A governmental order issued by the local health department requires all food processing businesses to deep clean their workplaces once every 24 hours in order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure. In order to comply with the governmental order, Employer K reduces its daily operating hours by five hours per day so that a deep cleaning may be conducted within its workplace once every 24 hours. Employer K is considered to have partially suspended its operations due to the governmental order requiring it to reduce its hours of operation."

    "title": "36. Is an employer that operates a trade or business in multiple locations and is subject to a governmental order requiring full or partial suspension of its operations in some jurisdictions, but not in others, considered to have a suspension of operations?",
    "content": "Yes. Employers that operate a trade or business in multiple locations and are subject to State and local governmental orders limiting operations in some, but not all, jurisdictions are considered to have a partial suspension of operations. Employers that operate a trade or business on a national or regional basis may be subject to governmental orders requiring closure of their locations in certain jurisdictions, but may not be subject to such a governmental order in other jurisdictions, including because it may be an essential business in some of those jurisdictions. To operate in a consistent manner in all jurisdictions, these employers may establish a policy that complies with the local governmental orders, as well as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) guidance; in this case, even though the employer may not be subject to a governmental order to suspend operations of its trade or business in certain jurisdictions, and may merely be following CDC or DHS guidelines in those jurisdictions, the employer would still be considered to have partially suspended operations. Therefore, the employer would be an Eligible Employer with respect to all of its operations in all locations. For more information regarding the application of the aggregation rules, see If the operations of a trade or business of one member of an aggregated group are suspended by a governmental order, are the operations of that trade or business of the other members of the aggregated group considered to be fully or partially suspended for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nExample:\nEmployer F is a national retail store chain with operations in every state in the United States. In some jurisdictions, Employer F is subject to a governmental order to close its stores, but it is permitted to provide customers with curbside service to pick up items ordered online or by phone. In other jurisdictions, Employer F is not subject to any governmental order to close its stores or is considered an essential business permitting its stores to remain open. Employer F establishes a company-wide policy, in compliance with the local governmental orders and consistent with the CDC and DHS recommendations and guidance, requiring the closure of all stores and operating with curbside pick-up only, even in those jurisdictions where the business was not subject to a governmental order. As a result of the governmental orders requiring closure of Employer F‚Äôs stores in certain jurisdictions, Employer F has a partial suspension of operations of its trade or business. The partial suspension results in Employer F being an Eligible Employer nationwide.\nThe employer may also be an Eligible Employer if it experiences a significant decline in gross receipts.

Accordingly, if a trade or business is operated by multiple members of an aggregated group and if the operations of one member of the aggregated group are suspended by a governmental order, then all members of the aggregated group are considered to have their operations partially suspended, even if another member of the group is in a jurisdiction that is not subject to a governmental order.\nExample:\nEmployer Group G is a restaurant chain that operates a single trade or business through multiple subsidiary corporations located in various jurisdictions. Certain members of Employer Group G‚Äôs operations are closed by a governmental order, while other members of Employer Group G‚Äôs operations remain open. As a result of a governmental order causing the suspension of operations of certain of Employer Group G members, the operations of all members of Employer Group G‚Äôs controlled group of corporations are treated as partially suspended due to the governmental order.\nFor more information on the aggregation rules, see Determining Which Entities are Considered a Single Employer Under the Aggregation Rules.\nAlternatively, the employer may be an Eligible Employer if the aggregated group experiences a significant decline in gross receipts.

If the order was effective for a portion of the calendar quarter, then the employer is an Eligible Employer for the entire calendar quarter but can only claim a credit for wages paid during the period the order is in force.\nExample:\nState Y issued a governmental order for all non-essential businesses to close from March 10 through April 30 and the governmental order was not extended. Pursuant to the order, Employer H, which operates a non-essential business in State Y, closes from March 10 through April 30. Employer H is an Eligible Employer in the first quarter (for wages paid from March 13, the effective date of section 2301 of the CARES Act, through March 31) and the second quarter (for wages paid from April 1 through April 30)."

The section 52(a) and (b) aggregation rules generally apply to determine when related entities are treated as a single employer for purposes of the application of tax credits available to an employer under section 51 of the Code, as well as for other Code provisions. The section 414(m) and (o) rules generally apply to determine when related entities, including affiliated service groups, are treated as a single employer for purposes of retirement and other employee benefit rules under the Code, as well as for other Code provisions.\nUnder the section 52 rules, corporate taxpayers may be required to aggregate as a parent-subsidiary controlled group, a brother-sister controlled group, or a combined group of corporations. Section 52(a) of the Code describes a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations, generally, as one or more chains of corporations where the common parent corporation owns more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or more than 50 percent of the value of all classes of stock of each corporation. A brother-sister controlled group of corporations, generally, is two or more corporations where: (1) five or fewer persons who are individuals, estates, or trusts own at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation; and (2) the same five or fewer persons, taking into account ownership only to the extent that it is identical with respect to each corporation, own more than 50 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation. A combined group of corporations is three or more corporations, each of which is a member of either a parent-subsidiary or a brother-sister controlled group, and at least one of which is both the common parent of a parent-subsidiary controlled group and also a member of a brother-sister controlled group.\nThe section 52(b) aggregation rules apply to partnerships, trusts, estates, or sole proprietorships in trades or businesses under common control. Under this rule, entities are considered a single employer if they are under common control applying rules similar to the parent-subsidiary or brother-sister controlled group rules or the rules for a combined group of corporations.\nUnder section 414(m) of the Code, an \"affiliated service group\" is treated as a single employer based on rules related to the performance of services by one entity for another or by one entity in association with another for third parties, even if the entity does not have sufficient ownership or control of the other entity to form a controlled group."

As a result, these employers must be aggregated for purposes of the following rules applicable to the Employee Retention Credit: Determining whether the employer has a trade or business operation that was fully or partially suspended due to orders related to COVID-19 from an appropriate governmental authority.

Breaking things down to the core factors and steps facilitates the option to itemize and prioritize. Unless we simplify, we run the risk of being lost in complexities. Simplifying also lets us eliminate what is unnecessary and redundant in the complexity. Simplification lets us focus on the precious few and ignore the distractions in a situation."

About one child in every five receives no education and is at risk. With the world's population set to grow by at least two billion over the next three decades, primarily in the developing world, these challenges can compound. At Occams Advisory, we take the right action by partnering with organizations like blossomprojects.org to implement preventative and remedial steps, working toward a brighter future for all."

    "content": "Generally, the qualified health plan expense is the amount that is allocable to the hours for which the employees receive other qualified wages. See:\nMay an Eligible Employer that averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019 treat its health plan expenses as ‚Äúqualified wages‚Äù for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?\nMay an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 employees in 2019 treat its health plan expenses as qualified wages if it continues the employees‚Äô health care coverage, but does not pay the employees‚Äô wages for the time for which the employees are not providing services?\nMay an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019 treat its health plan expenses as qualified wages if it continues the employees‚Äô health care coverage and pays its employees a reduced amount of wages for the time the employees are not providing services?\nQualified health plan expenses are properly treated as qualified wages if the allocation is made on a pro rata basis among covered employees (for example, the average premium for all employees covered by a policy) and pro rata on the basis of periods of coverage (relative to the time periods for which such wages relate)."

    "title": "63. Does the amount of qualified health plan expenses include both the portion of the cost paid by the Eligible Employer and the portion of the cost paid by the employee?",
    "content": "The amount of qualified health plan expenses taken into account in determining the amount of qualified wages generally includes both the portion of the cost paid by the Eligible Employer and the portion of the cost paid by the employee with pre-tax salary reduction contributions. However, the qualified health plan expenses should not include amounts that the employee paid for with after-tax contributions."

    "title": "64. May an Eligible Employer that averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019 treat its health plan expenses as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit? (updated May 7, 2020)",
    "content": "Yes. An Eligible Employer that averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019 may treat its health plan expenses paid or incurred, after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021, during any period in a calendar quarter in which the employer‚Äôs business operations are fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order or a calendar quarter in which the employer experiences a significant decline in gross receipts as qualified wages, subject to the maximum of $10,000 per employee for all calendar quarters for all qualified wages. Eligible Employers may treat health plan expenses allocable to the applicable periods as qualified wages even if the employees are not working and the Eligible Employer does not pay the employees any wages for the time they are not working.\nExample 1: Employer Y averaged 100 or fewer employees in 2019. Employer Y is subject to a governmental order that partially suspends the operation of its trade or business. In response to the governmental order, Employer Y reduces all employees‚Äô hours by 50 percent. It pays wages to the employees only for the time the employees are providing services, but Employer Y continues to provide the employees with full health care coverage. Employer Y‚Äôs health plan expenses allocable to wages paid during the period its operations were partially suspended may be treated as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample 2: Employer Z averaged 100 or fewer employees in 2019. Employer Z is subject to a governmental order that suspends the operation of its trade or business. In response to the governmental order, Employer Z lays off or furloughs all of its employees. It does not pay wages to its employees for the time they are laid off or furloughed and not working, but it continues the employees‚Äô health care coverage. Employer Z‚Äôs health plan expenses allocable to the period its operations were partially suspended may be treated as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit."

An Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019 may treat its health plan expenses paid or incurred, after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021, allocable to the time that the employees are not providing services during any period in a calendar quarter in which the employer‚Äôs business operations are fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order or a calendar quarter in which the employer experiences a significant decline in gross receipts as qualified wages, subject to the maximum of $10,000 per employee for all calendar quarters for all qualified wages. However, an Eligible Employer may not treat health plan expenses allocable to the time for which the employees are receiving wages for providing services as qualified wages; only the portion of health plan expenses allocable to the time that the employees are not providing services are treated as qualified wages.\nExample 1: Employer A averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019. Employer A is subject to a governmental order that partially suspends the operation of its trade or business. In response to the governmental order, Employer A reduces all employees‚Äô hours by 50 percent and pays wages to its employees only for the time that the employees are providing services, but Employer A continues to provide the employees with full health care coverage.

Employer B is subject to a governmental order that partially suspends the operations of its trade or business. In response to the governmental order, Employer B reduces its employees‚Äô hours by 50 percent, but it reduces its employees‚Äô wages by only 40 percent, so that the employees receive 60 percent of their wages for 50 percent of their normal hours. Employer B continues to cover 100 percent of the employees‚Äô health plan expenses. In this case, Employer B may treat as qualified wages: (i) the 10 percent of the wages that it pays employees for time the employees are not providing services, plus (ii) 50 percent of the health plan expenses, because the health plan expenses are allocable to the time that employees were not providing services.\nExample 3: Employer C is subject to a governmental order that fully suspends the operations of its trade or business. Employer C lays off or furloughs its employees and does not pay wages to the employees, but does continue to cover 100 percent of the employees‚Äô health plan expenses.

For an Eligible Employer that sponsors more than one plan for its employees (for example, both a group health plan and a health flexible spending arrangement (health FSA)), or more than one plan covering different employees, how are the qualified health plan expenses for each employee determined?",
    "content": "The qualified health plan expenses are determined separately for each plan. Then, for each plan, those expenses are allocated to the employees who participate in that plan. In the case of an employee who participates in more than one plan, the allocated expenses of each plan in which the employee participates are aggregated for that employee."

  {
    "title": "67. For an Eligible Employer who sponsors a fully-insured group health plan, how are the qualified health plan expenses of that plan allocated to the qualified wages on a pro rata basis?",
    "content": "An Eligible Employer who sponsors a fully-insured group health plan may use any reasonable method to determine and allocate the plan expenses, including (1) the COBRA applicable premium for the employee typically available from the insurer, (2) one average premium rate for all employees, or (3) a substantially similar method that takes into account the average premium rate determined separately for employees with self-only and other than self-only coverage.\nIf an Eligible Employer chooses to use one average premium rate for all employees, the allocable amount for each day an employee covered by the insured group health plan is entitled to qualified wages could be determined using the following steps:\nThe Eligible Employer‚Äôs overall annual premium for the employees covered by the policy is divided by the number of employees covered by the policy to determine the average annual premium per employee.\nThe average annual premium per employee is divided by the average number of work days during the year by all covered employees (treating days of paid leave as a work day and a work day as including any day on which work is performed) to determine the average daily premium per employee. For example, a full-year employee working five days per week may be treated as working 52 weeks x 5 days or 260 days. Calculations for part-time and seasonal employees who participate in the plan should be adjusted as appropriate. Eligible Employers may use any reasonable method for calculating part-time employee work days.\nThe resulting premium should be adjusted to reflect any portion that employees contribute after-tax.\nThe resulting amount is the amount allocated to each day of qualified wages.\nExample: Employer D sponsors an insured group health plan that covers 400 employees, some with self-only coverage and some with family coverage. Each employee is expected to have 260 work days a year. (Five days a week for 52 weeks.) The employees contribute a portion of their premium by pre-tax salary reduction, with different amounts for self-only and family. The total annual premium for the 400 employees is $5.2 million. (This includes both the amount paid by the Eligible Employer and the amounts paid by employees through salary reduction.)\nFor an Eligible Employer using one average premium rate for all employees, the average annual premium rate is $5.2 million divided by 400, or $13,000. For each employee expected to have 260 work days a year, this results in a daily average premium rate equal to $13,000 divided by 260, or $50. That $50 is the amount of qualified health plan expenses allocated to each day of qualified wages per employee."

    "content": "An Eligible Employer who sponsors a self-insured group health plan may use any reasonable method to determine and allocate the health plan expenses, including (1) the COBRA applicable premium for the employee typically available from the administrator, or (2) any reasonable actuarial method to determine the estimated annual expenses of the plan.\nIf the Eligible Employer uses a reasonable actuarial method to determine the estimated annual expenses of the plan, then rules similar to the rules for insured plans are used to determine the amount of health plan expenses allocated to an employee. That is, the estimated annual expense is divided by the number of employees covered by the plan, and that amount is divided by the average number of work days during the year by the employees (treating days of paid leave as work days and any day on which an employee performs any work as work days). The resulting amount is the amount allocated to each day of qualified wages. Adjustments should be made for employee after-tax contributions."

    "content": "The amount of qualified health plan expenses may include contributions to an HRA (including an individual coverage HRA), or a health FSA, but does not include contributions to a QSEHRA.

    "content": "No. Section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\") excludes from a taxpayer's gross income certain payments to individuals to reimburse or pay for expenses related to a qualified disaster (\"qualified disaster relief payments\"). Although the COVID-19 outbreak is a \"qualified disaster\" for purposes of section 139 the Code, qualified wages are not excludible qualified disaster relief payments, because qualified wages are what an individual would otherwise earn as compensation, rather than payments to offset any particular expenses that an individual would incur due to COVID-19.\nSection 139(c)(2) of the Code provides that for purposes of section 139 of the Code, the term \"qualified disaster\" includes a disaster determined by the President to warrant assistance by the Federal government under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5207. The President has made such a disaster determination for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. Territories. A \"qualified disaster relief payment\" is defined by section 139(b) of the Code to include any amount paid to or for the benefit of an individual to reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary personal, family, living, or funeral expenses incurred as a result of a qualified disaster. Qualified disaster relief payments do not include qualified wages paid by an employer, even those that are paid when an employee is not providing services."

    "title": "17. What is a \"trade or business\" for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?",
    "content": "For purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, ‚Äútrade or business‚Äù has the same meaning as when used in section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù) other than the trade or business of performing services as an employee. Under section 162 of the Code, an activity does not qualify as a trade or business unless its primary purpose is to make a profit and it is carried on with regularity and continuity. The facts and circumstances of each case determine whether an activity is a trade or business. A taxpayer does not necessarily need to make a profit in any particular year in order to be in a trade or business as long as a good faith profit motive is present.\nFor purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, a tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c) of the Code that is exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code is deemed to be engaged in a ‚Äútrade or business‚Äù with respect to all operations of the organization."

    "title": "19. What organizations are considered an \"instrumentality\" of the Federal government, or of a State or local government, for purposes of determining if an employer is eligible for the Employee Retention Credit?",
    "content": "In general, for employment tax purposes, the IRS considers six factors in determining whether an organization is an instrumentality:\nwhether the organization is used for a governmental purpose and performs a governmental function;\nwhether performance of the organization‚Äôs function is on behalf of one or more States or political subdivisions;\nwhether there are any private interests involved, or whether the States or political subdivisions involved have the powers and interests of an owner;\nwhether control and supervision of the organization is vested in a public authority or authorities;\nif express or implied statutory or other authority is necessary for the creation and/or use of such an instrumentality, and whether such authority exists; and\nthe degree of financial autonomy and the source of its operating expenses.\nSee Rev. Rul. 57-128, 1957-1 C.B. 311. No one factor is determinative; instrumentality status is based on all the facts and circumstances. These same factors apply to identify an instrumentality for purposes of determining whether an employer is eligible for the Employee Retention Credit."

    "title": "20. Are tax-exempt employers eligible for the Employee Retention Credit?",
    "content": "Yes, organizations described in section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù), and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code, may be Eligible Employers for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit if they are employers that otherwise meet the requirements to be eligible for the credit."

    "title": "21. Are tribal governments and tribal entities eligible for the Employee Retention Credit? (updated November 16, 2020)",
    "content": "Yes. Any tribal government or tribal entity that carries on a trade or business may be an Eligible Employer for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, if it otherwise meets the requirements for the credit.\nAs a general rule, whether activities constitute a trade or business for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit is determined under section 162 of the Code. However, because tribal governments are not subject to income tax under the Code and, therefore, are generally not otherwise required to determine whether a tribal activity is a trade or business under section 162 of the Code, the Treasury Department and the IRS have concluded that the section 162 standards are not the appropriate bases for determining whether a tribal government is carrying on a trade or business for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Instead, solely for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, a tribal government is treated as carrying on trade or business activities, and all activities conducted by the tribal government will be considered part of those trade or business activities. In addition, solely for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, any entity that a tribal government reasonably believes shares the same tax status as the tribal government (tribal entity employer) is treated as carrying on trade or business activities, and all activities conducted by the tribal entity employer will be considered part of those trade or business activities. Any entity other than a tribal government or a tribal entity employer must determine whether its activities constitute carrying on a trade or business under section 162 for purpose of determining eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit."

    "content": "Yes. Employers may claim the Employee Retention Credit for payments of ‚Äúqualified wages.‚Äù Section 2301(c)(5) of the CARES Act provides that qualified wages are wages as defined in section 3121(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù) for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (‚ÄúFICA‚Äù) tax. Under section 3121(b) of the Code, payments of wages by employers in U.S. Territories are subject to FICA.

    "content": "Yes. Section 2301(e) of the CARES Act provides that rules similar to section 280C(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù) shall apply for purposes of applying the Employee Retention Credit. Section 280C(a) of the Code generally disallows a deduction for the portion of wages paid equal to the sum of certain credits determined for the taxable year. Accordingly, a similar deduction disallowance would apply under the Employee Retention Credit, such that an employer‚Äôs aggregate deductions would be reduced by the amount of the credit as result of this disallowance rule."

Neither the portion of the credit that reduces the employer‚Äôs applicable employment taxes, nor the refundable portion of the credit, is included in the employer‚Äôs gross income."

    "title": "87. Can an Eligible Employer that uses a third party to report and pay employment taxes to the IRS get the Employee Retention Credit?",
    "content": "Yes, if a common law employer is otherwise eligible to receive the Employee Retention Credit, it is entitled to the credit, regardless of whether it uses a third party payer (such as a reporting agent, payroll service provider, PEO, CPEO, or agent) to report and pay its federal employment taxes. The third party payer is not entitled to the Employee Retention Credit with respect to the wages it remits on the employer‚Äôs behalf (regardless of whether the third party is considered an ‚Äúemployer‚Äù for other purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù)). If an employer uses a third party to file, report, and pay employment taxes, certain rules for claiming/reporting the Employee Retention Credit will apply depending on the type of third party payer the employer uses.\n\nIf an Eligible Employer uses a reporting agent to file the Form 941, Employer‚Äôs Quarterly Federal Tax Return, the reporting agent will need to reflect the Employee Retention Credit on the Form 941 it files on the employer‚Äôs behalf.\n\nIf an Eligible Employer uses a CPEO or a 3504 agent to report its federal employment taxes on an aggregate Form 941, the CPEO or 3504 agent will report the Employee Retention Credit on its aggregate Form 941 and Schedule R, Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers, that it already files. An Eligible Employer can submit its own Form 7200, Advance Payment of Employer Credits Due to COVID-19, to claim the advance credit. The Eligible Employer will need to provide a copy of the Form 7200 to the CPEO or 3504 agent so the CPEO or 3504 agent can properly report the Employee Retention Credit on the Form 941.\n\nIf an Eligible Employer uses a non-certified PEO to report and pay its federal employment taxes, the PEO will need to report the Employee Retention Credit on an aggregate Form 941 and separately report the Employee Retention Credit allocable to the employers for which it is filing the aggregate Form 941 on an accompanying schedule R. The PEO does not have to complete Schedule R with respect to employers for which it is not claiming an Employee Retention Credit. The Eligible Employer will need to provide a copy of any Form 7200 that it submitted for an advance to the PEO so the PEO can properly report the Employee Retention Credit on the Form 941. These rules are similar to the rules that apply with respect to the payroll tax election available under section 41(h) of the Code for the credit for certain research and development expenses."

However, qualified wages paid during the first quarter of 2020 should be reported on the employer‚Äôs second quarter Form 941, Employer‚Äôs Quarterly Tax Return.

    "content": "A significant decline in gross receipts is calculated by determining the first calendar quarter in 2020 (if any) in which an employer‚Äôs gross receipts are less than 50 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019. If the gross receipts decline to that extent, the employer also must later determine if there is a later calendar quarter in 2020 in which the employer‚Äôs 2020 quarterly gross receipts are greater than 80 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019. If so, the significant decline in gross receipts ends with the first calendar quarter that follows the first calendar quarter in which the employer‚Äôs 2020 quarterly gross receipts are greater than 80 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019, or with the first calendar quarter of 2021.\n\nExample:\nEmployer I‚Äôs gross receipts were $100,000, $190,000, and $230,000 in the first, second, and third calendar quarters of 2020, respectively. Its gross receipts were $210,000, $230,000, and $250,000 in the first, second, and third calendar quarters of 2019, respectively. Thus, Employer I‚Äôs 2020 first, second, and third quarter gross receipts were approximately 48 percent, 83 percent, and 92 percent of its 2019 first, second, and third quarter gross receipts, respectively. Accordingly, Employer I had a significant decline in gross receipts commencing on the first day of the first calendar quarter of 2020 (the calendar quarter in which gross receipts were less than 50 percent of the same quarter in 2019) and ending on the first day of the third calendar quarter of 2020 (the quarter following the quarter for which the gross receipts were more than 80 percent of the same quarter in 2019). Thus, Employer I is entitled to a retention credit with respect to the first and second calendar quarters."

    "title": "40. What are \"gross receipts\" for an employer other than a tax-exempt organization?",
    "content": "‚ÄúGross receipts‚Äù for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit for an employer other than a tax-exempt organization has the same meaning as when used under section 448(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù). Under the section 448(c) regulations, ‚Äúgross receipts‚Äù means gross receipts of the taxable year and generally includes total sales (net of returns and allowances) and all amounts received for services. In addition, gross receipts include any income from investments, and from incidental or outside sources. For example, gross receipts include interest (including original issue discount and tax-exempt interest within the meaning of section 103 of the Code), dividends, rents, royalties, and annuities, regardless of whether such amounts are derived in the ordinary course of the taxpayer‚Äôs trade or business. Gross receipts are generally not reduced by cost of goods sold, but are generally reduced by the taxpayer‚Äôs adjusted basis in capital assets sold. Gross receipts do not include the repayment of a loan, or amounts received with respect to sales tax if the tax is legally imposed on the purchaser of the good or service, and the taxpayer merely collects and remits the sales tax to the taxing authority."

    "content": "Yes. The employer may claim the Employee Retention Credit on qualified wages paid in 2020 if it determines that a significant decline in gross receipts occurred in 2020 even if it does not make the determination until after January 1, 2021. In this case, the employer may claim the credit by filing the appropriate form to report adjustments to its employment taxes, typically Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer‚Äôs Quarterly Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund.\n\nFor more information on correcting employment taxes, see Correcting Employment Taxes."

    "title": "43. For an aggregated group, is the significant decline in gross receipts test determined based on the entire group?",

All entities are considered a single employer for purposes of determining whether the employer had a significant decline in gross receipts if they are aggregated as a controlled group of corporations under section 52(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù); are partnerships, trusts or sole proprietorships under common control under section 52(b) of the Code; or are entities that are aggregated under section 414(m) or (o) of the Code. For more information, see Determining Which Entities are Considered a Single Employer Under the Aggregation Rules.\n\nTo be an Eligible Employer on the basis of a significant decline of gross receipts, the employer must take into account the gross receipts of all members of the aggregated group. If the aggregated group does not experience a significant decline in gross receipts, then no member of the group may claim the Employee Retention Credit on that basis.\n\nExample:\nEmployer J and Employer K are members of a section 52(a) controlled group of corporations. Neither Employer J nor Employer K is subject to a governmental order suspending business operations, and neither received a Paycheck Protection Program loan. Employer J has gross receipts of $1,000,000 in the second quarter of 2019 and $400,000 in the second quarter of 2020. Employer K has gross receipts of $1,000,000 in second quarter of 2019 and $750,000 in second quarter of 2020. Although Employer J‚Äôs gross receipts in the second quarter of 2020 were 40 percent of its 2019 second quarter gross receipts, neither Employer J nor Employer K can claim the Employee Retention Credit under the gross receipts test. Employers J and K had combined gross receipts of $2,000,000 in the second quarter of 2019 and $1,150,000 in the second quarter of 2020. Their combined gross receipts for the second quarter of 2020 would have had to be less than $1,000,000 (50 percent of $2,000,000) for Employers J and K to have experienced a significant decline in gross receipts for the second quarter of 2020."

Solely for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, when an employer compares its gross receipts for a 2020 calendar quarter when it owns an acquired business to its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019, the employer may, to the extent the information is available, include the gross receipts of the acquired business in its gross receipts for the 2019 calendar quarter. Under this safe harbor approach, the employer may include these gross receipts regardless of the fact that the employer did not own the acquired business during that 2019 calendar quarter.\n\nAn employer that acquires a trade or business in the middle of a calendar quarter in 2020 and that chooses to use this safe harbor approach must estimate the gross receipts it would have had from that acquired business for the entire quarter based on the gross receipts for the portion of the quarter that it owned and operated the acquired business. However, an employer that chooses not to use this safe harbor approach is only required to include the gross receipts from the acquired business for the portion of the quarter that it owned and operated the acquired business.\n\nExample:\nEmployer L acquired all of the assets of a trade or business in a taxable transaction on January 1, 2020. The gross receipts of the acquired business were $50,000 for the quarter beginning January 1, 2020 and ending March 31, 2020 and $200,000 for the quarter beginning January 1, 2019 and ending March 31, 2019. Employer L has access to the books and records from the prior owner of the acquired trade or business and can determine the amount of gross receipts attributable to the trade or business for the quarter beginning January 1, 2019 and ending March 31, 2019. For purposes of the Employee Retention Credit, Employer L must include $50,000 in its gross receipts computation for the quarter beginning January 1, 2020 and ending March 31, 2020 (Employer L actually owned the trade or business) and may include $200,000 in its gross receipts computation for the quarter beginning January 1, 2019 and ending March 31, 2019."

    "title": "46. What are \"gross receipts\" for a tax-exempt employer? (updated June 19, 2020)",
    "content": "Solely for purposes of determining eligibility for the Employee Retention Credit, gross receipts for a tax-exempt employer include gross receipts from all operations, not only from activities that constitute unrelated trades or businesses. For example, gross receipts for this purpose include amounts received by the organization from total sales (net of returns and allowances) and all amounts received for services, whether or not those sales or services are substantially related to the organization‚Äôs exercise or performance of the exempt purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption. Gross receipts also include the organization‚Äôs investment income, including from dividends, rents, and royalties, as well as the gross amount received as contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts, and the gross amount received as dues or assessments from members or affiliated organizations.\n\nTo determine whether there has been a significant decline in gross receipts, a tax-exempt employer computes its gross receipts received from all of its operations during the calendar quarter and compares those gross receipts to the same gross receipts received for the same calendar quarter in 2019."

    "title": "47. How is the maximum amount of the Employee Retention Credit available to Eligible Employers determined?",
    "content": "The credit equals 50 percent of the qualified wages (including qualified health plan expenses) that an Eligible Employer pays in a calendar quarter. The maximum amount of qualified wages taken into account with respect to each employee for all calendar quarters is $10,000, so that the maximum credit for qualified wages paid to any employee is $5,000.\n\nExample 1:\nEmployer M pays $10,000 in qualified wages to Employee A in the second quarter of 2020. The Employee Retention Credit available to Employer M for the qualified wages paid to Employee A is $5,000.\n\nExample 2:\nEmployer N pays $8,000 in qualified wages to Employee B in the second quarter 2020 and $8,000 in qualified wages in the third quarter 2020. The credit available to Employer N for the qualified wages paid to Employee B is equal to $4,000 in the second quarter and $1,000 in the third quarter due to the overall limit of 50 percent of $10,000 of qualified wages per employee for all calendar quarters."

    "title": "48. What is the definition of \"qualified wages\"?",
    "content": "Qualified wages are wages (as defined in section 3121(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\")) and compensation (as defined in section 3231(e) of the Code), both determined without regard to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act), paid by an Eligible Employer to some or all of its employees after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021. Qualified wages include the Eligible Employer's qualified health plan expenses that are properly allocable to the wages.\nThe specific circumstances in which wage payments by an Eligible Employer will be considered qualified wages depend, in part, on the average number of full-time employees it employed during 2019. For an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, qualified wages are the wages paid to an employee for time that the employee is not providing services due to either (1) a full or partial suspension of the employer's business operations by a governmental order, or (2) the business experiencing a significant decline in gross receipts. For an Eligible Employer that averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019, qualified wages are the wages paid to any employee during any period in the calendar quarter in which the business operations are fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order or any calendar quarter the business is experiencing a significant decline in gross receipts."
  },
  {
    "title": "49. How does an Eligible Employer identify the average number of full-time employees employed during 2019?",
    "content": "The term ‚Äúfull-time employee‚Äù means an employee who, with respect to any calendar month in 2019, had an average of at least 30 hours of service per week or 130 hours of service in the month (130 hours of service in a month is treated as the monthly equivalent of at least 30 hours of service per week), as determined in accordance with section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code. An employer that operated its business for the entire 2019 calendar year determines the number of its full-time employees by taking the sum of the number of full-time employees in each calendar month in 2019 and dividing that number by 12.\nAn employer that started its business operations during 2019 determines the number of its full-time employees by taking the sum of the number of full-time employees in each full calendar month in 2019 in which the employer operated its business and dividing by that number of months.\nAn employer that started its business operations during 2020 determines the number of its full-time employees by taking the sum of the number of full-time employees in each full calendar month in 2020 in which the employer operated its business and dividing by that number of months, consistent with the approach discussed above for employers that began business operations during 2019."
  },
  {
    "title": "50. Does an Eligible Employer identify the average number of full-time employees based on the aggregation rule?",
    "content": "Yes. All entities are considered a single employer for purposes of determining the employer‚Äôs average number of employees if: they are aggregated as a controlled group of corporations under section 52(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù); are partnerships, trusts or sole proprietorships under common control under section 52(b) of the Code; or are entities that are aggregated under section 414(m) or (o) of the Code.\nExample:\nEmployers O and P each have 75 full-time employees, respectively. Employers O and P are corporations that have each issued a single class of common stock, and a single individual owns more than 80 percent of the common stock of both Employer O and Employer P. Employers O and P are therefore treated as a single Eligible Employer with more than 100 full-time employees for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Accordingly, each is eligible for the Employee Retention Credit only for wages paid to an employee that is not providing services due to either (1) a full or partial suspension of operations by governmental order, or (2) a significant decline in gross receipts."

    "content": "No. Eligible Employers that averaged more than 100 full-time employees for 2019 may not treat the wages paid to employees for the time that they provide services to the employer as qualified wages. For these employers, only wages paid to employees, after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021, for the time they are not providing services during a calendar quarter in which the employer‚Äôs business operations are fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order or in which the employer experiences a significant decline in gross receipts may be treated as qualified wages.\nExample 1:\nEmployer Q, a local chain of full service restaurants in State X that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, is subject to a governmental order for restaurants to discontinue sit-down service to customers inside the restaurant, but may continue food or beverage sales to the public on a carry-out, drive-through, or delivery basis. Employer Q continues to pay wages to kitchen staff and certain wait staff needed to facilitate fulfillment of carry-out orders. Wages paid to these employees for the time that they provide carry-out service are not qualified wages.\nExample 2:\nEmployer R averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019 and was forced to suspend operations at the end of the first calendar quarter in 2020. Its employees performed services during the first part of the calendar quarter but then stopped due to the suspension of operations; however, Employer R continued to pay the employees‚Äô normal wages for the entire quarter, including the period during which they were not providing services. The wages paid during the period when employees were not providing services are qualified wages."

  {
    "title": "53. May an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees during 2019 claim an Employee Retention Credit for an increase in the amount of wages it paid its employees during the time that employees are not providing services?",
    "content": "No. For Eligible Employers that averaged more than 100 full-time employees during 2019, qualified wages paid to an employee may not exceed what the employee would have been paid for working an equivalent duration during the 30 days immediately preceding the commencement of the full or partial suspension of the operation of the trade or business or the first day of the calendar quarter in which the employer experienced a significant decline in gross receipts. For a variable hour employee, the amount paid for working an equivalent duration during that 30-day period may be determined using any reasonable method. The method(s) that the Department of Labor has prescribed to determine the amount to pay an employee with an irregular schedule who is entitled to paid sick leave under the FFCRA would be considered reasonable for this purpose. For more information, see Department of Labor‚Äôs Temporary Rule: Paid Leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.\nExample:\nEmployer S, a grocery store chain that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, is subject to a governmental order limiting store hours. In response, Employer S has reduced the hours its employees work, but in order to incentivize those employees who continue to provide services, the employer increases the employees‚Äô rate of pay by $1 an hour. Only the amounts paid to employees for time they are not providing services, and at the rate of pay in effect prior to the increase, would be considered qualified wages."

    "title": "54. May an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees during 2019 treat the wages paid to hourly and non-exempt salaried employees for hours for which they are not providing services as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?",
    "content": "Yes. For an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, wages paid to hourly and non-exempt salaried employees for hours that the employees were not providing services would be considered qualified wages for the purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. For an employee who does not have a fixed schedule of work, the hours for which the employee is not providing services may be determined using any reasonable method. The method that the Eligible Employer would use to determine the employee‚Äôs entitlement to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act would be a reasonable method for this purpose. Similarly, the method(s) that the Department of Labor has prescribed to determine the number of hours for which an employee with an irregular schedule is entitled to paid sick leave under the FFCRA would be considered reasonable for this purpose. For more information, see Department of Labor‚Äôs Temporary Rule: Paid Leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.\nIt is not reasonable for the employer to treat an employee‚Äôs hours as having been reduced based on an assessment of the employee‚Äôs productivity levels during the hours the employee is working.\nWages paid to the employees for hours for which they provided services are not considered qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample 1:\nEmployer T, a manufacturing business, that averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, has several locations that are closed during the second quarter of 2020 due to a governmental order. Employer T continues to pay hourly employees who are not providing services at the closed locations 50 percent of their normal hourly wage rates. Employer T also reduced headquarters‚Äô administrative staff hours by 40 percent, but continues to pay them at 100 percent of their normal hourly wage rates. For employees who are not providing services due to the closure of their location, but are receiving 50 percent of their normal hourly wage rates, Employer T may treat the wages paid as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. For the administrative staff whose hours were reduced by 40 percent, but who are paid for 100 percent of the normal wage rate, Employer T may treat the 40 percent of wages paid for time that these employees are not providing services as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. The 60 percent of wages that Employer T pays the administrative staff for hours during which the employees are actually providing services is not considered qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample 2:\nEmployer U, in the business of staging homes that are for sale, averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019. Employer U‚Äôs non-exempt salaried employees cannot perform their usual services of delivering and installing furniture to be used in staging houses because open houses are prohibited in its service area during the second quarter of 2020. However, the employees are required to provide Employer U with periodic status updates about furniture that has been leased out and other administrative matters. Employer U continues to pay wages to employees at their normal rates even though the employees cannot provide their normal services. Employer U has determined that its employees are working 20 percent of the time. Employer U is entitled to treat 80 percent of the wages paid as qualified wages and claim an Employee Retention Credit for 80 percent of the wages paid."

For an Eligible Employer that averaged more than 100 full-time employees during 2019, the wages paid after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021, to exempt salaried employees for the time that they are not providing services would be considered qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. An Eligible Employer may use any reasonable method to determine the number of hours that a salaried employee is not providing services, but for which the employee receives wages either at the employee‚Äôs normal wage rate or at a reduced wage rate. Reasonable methods include the method (or methods) the employer uses to measure exempt employees‚Äô entitlement to leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule under the Family and Medical Leave Act, or the method the employer uses to measure exempt employees‚Äô entitlement to and usage of paid leave under the employer‚Äôs usual practices. It is not reasonable for the employer to treat an employee‚Äôs hours as having been reduced based on an assessment of the employee‚Äôs productivity levels during the hours the employee is working.\nExample 1:\nEmployer V, a large fitness club business that employed an average of more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, closed all of its locations in City B by order of City B‚Äôs mayor. Employer V continues to pay its exempt managerial employees their regular salaries. While the clubs are closed and there is not sufficient administrative work to occupy the managerial employees full-time, they continue to perform some accounting and similar administrative functions. Employer V has determined, based on the time records maintained by employees, that they are providing services for 10 percent of their typical work hours. In this case, 90 percent of wages paid to these employees during the period the clubs were closed are qualified wages.\nExample 2:\nEmployer W, a large consulting firm that employed an average of more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, closed its offices due to various governmental orders and required all employees to telework. Although Employer W believes that some of its employees may not be as productive while working remotely, employees are working their normal business hours. Because employees‚Äô work hours have not changed, no portion of the wages paid to the employees by Employer W are qualified wages."

    "content": "If the Eligible Employer averaged more than 100 full-time employees in 2019, the employer may not treat as qualified wages amounts paid to employees for paid time off for vacations, holidays, sick days and other days off. These wages are paid pursuant to existing leave policies that represent benefits accrued during a prior period in which the employees provided services and are not wages paid for time in which the employees are not providing services.\nHowever, if the Eligible Employer averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019, all wages paid to employees during the period of the full or partial suspension of operations or the significant decline in gross receipts, even if under a pre-existing vacation, sick and other leave policy, may be qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit (unless the wages are qualified sick and/or family leave wages under sections 7001 and 7003 of the FFCRA)."

    "title": "57. May an Eligible Employer treat payments made to former employees who have terminated employment as qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit?",
    "content": "No. Payments, including severance payments, made to a former employee following termination of employment are not considered qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit. Payments may be considered qualified wages only if the payments are made to an employee who continues to be employed by the Eligible Employer. Payments made in connection with a former employee‚Äôs termination of employment are not qualified wages because they are payments for the past employment relationship and thus are not attributable to the time for which the Employee Retention Credit may be claimed. See United States v. Quality Stores, Inc., 572 U.S. 141 (2014). Whether an employee has terminated employment is based on all of the facts and circumstances, including whether the employer has treated the employment relationship as terminated for purposes other than the continuation of wage payments."

    "title": "58. If an amount an Eligible Employer pays to an employee is exempt from social security and Medicare taxes, can the Eligible Employer still claim the Employee Retention Credit on the amount paid to that employee? (updated June 19, 2020)",
    "content": "No. The Employee Retention Credit is allowed on qualified wages paid to employees; an amount must constitute wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù) (or must constitute qualified health plan expenses allocable to such wages) in order to fall within the definition of qualified wages.\nExample 1:\nA church in State X employs an ordained minister; the minister is a common law employee of the church. The governor of State X issues an executive order limiting gatherings of more than 10 people. As a result, the church suspends Sunday worship services, but continues to pay the minister‚Äôs salary and parsonage allowance. The minister‚Äôs salary and parsonage allowance do not constitute wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) of the Code and therefore are not qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample 2:\nA group of licensed real estate agents at Real Estate Brokerage Firm Y receive substantially all their payments for services directly related to home sales and perform services under a written contract providing that they will not be treated as employees for federal tax purposes. Therefore, the licensed real estate agents at Real Estate Brokerage Firm Y are treated as statutory nonemployees under the Code. Amounts paid to the licensed real estate agents at Real Estate Brokerage Firm Y do not constitute wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) of the Code and therefore are not qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit.\nExample 3:\nEmployer Z offers its employees various benefits that provide for pre-tax salary reduction contributions, including a qualified 401(k) plan, a fully-insured group health plan, a dependent care assistance program satisfying the requirements of section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), and qualified transportation benefits satisfying the requirements of section 132(f) of the Code. Employer Z also makes matching and nonelective contributions to the qualified 401(k) plan and pays the portion of the cost of maintaining the group health plan remaining after the employees‚Äô share.\nEmployer Z may treat as qualified wages the amounts its employees contribute as pre-tax salary reduction contributions to the qualified 401(k) plan because those amounts are wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) of the Code.\nEmployer Z may also treat all amounts paid toward maintaining the group health plan (including any employee pre-tax salary reduction contribution) as qualified health plan expenses that may be allocated to wages. See ‚ÄúDoes the amount of qualified health plan expenses include both the portion of the cost paid by the Eligible Employer and the portion of the cost paid by the employee?‚Äù\nEmployer Z may not treat as qualified wages the amounts Employer Z contributes as matching or nonelective contributions to the qualified 401(k) plan, nor may it treat as qualified wages any employee pre-tax salary reduction contributions toward the dependent care assistance program or qualified transportation benefits. These amounts do not constitute wages within the meaning of section 3121(a) of the Code and therefore are not qualified wages for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit."
